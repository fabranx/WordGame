# WordGame


Web app created with react, in which there is a keyboard layout and a word to write.

The web app reads the keys pressed by the player: for each correct letter it increases the score by 1, for each wrong letter it decreases the score by 1. As we write the word, it is colored green.

If at least 2 whole words are typed correctly without making mistakes, the bonus score is increased. The bonus score increases as the number of consecutive correct words increases. The higher the number of consecutive words, the greater the increase in the bonus score for each correct word.

If you miss a letter number of consecutive words is reset to 0.

At the end of the timer the total score and statistics are displayed
